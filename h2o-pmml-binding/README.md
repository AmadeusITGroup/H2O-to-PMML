# H2O2PMML POJO Transformation Between H2O and PMML

This folder contains the binding project between H2O and PMML. First, it parses H2O binary trees and their associated metadata file (model.ini and the domains files) and represents them as POJOs. Then, it uses these H2O POJOs to build some PMML POJOs representing the binary trees. The imported PMML POJOs were generated by the pmml-4-3-pojo project. Finally, it uses JAXB to serialize these PMML POJOs to XML files.

# Quick Start

From the root directory of this Maven project:

    maven clean install

The resulting .jar will be available in the ./target folder, and it will be available in your local maven repository.
